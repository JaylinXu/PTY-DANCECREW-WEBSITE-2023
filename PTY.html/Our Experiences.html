			<h2>Dance</h2>
			<p>First and foremost, having a positive mindset when it comes to dancing is essential. Understanding that progress is a gradual process, and embracing the changes that come with it, is vital. As members of PTY, we came together because of our shared love for dance. Through our passion and dedication, we can invest the necessary time and energy to reap the rewards. Our paths crossed at DancelifeXcenter Studio in downtown Toronto. Finding the right dance teacher or class is crucial. You can learn proper technique and form by selecting courses and instructors that align with your skill level and interests while ensuring your movements are executed correctly. Classes also offer opportunities to meet other dancers, receive feedback and advice, and build a community. To start, practice the fundamentals. A solid foundation will facilitate the acquisition of complex choreography and higher-level skills. It is also helpful to watch various dance videos, as this will expose you to different styles and inspire creativity. You can also learn new techniques and movements from videos and incorporate them into your own dancing. Repetitive practice will help to reinforce technique, improve proficiency, and establish muscle memory.</p>

		<h2>Rehearsals</h2>
		<p>Group dance rehearsals are never a solo endeavour. Understanding and taking care of each other as a team is essential. For example, when scheduling rehearsals, it is important to consider everyone's schedules and find a suitable time for training. Communication is key. In order to achieve synchronicity in a group dance, it is essential to have good communication skills. Finding ways to work together efficiently and harmoniously will enhance team cohesion. Building a sense of trust and mutual respect is essential in a group dance, as

		<h2>Videography</h2>
		<p>When it comes to video shooting, factors such as location and post-production need to be taken into consideration. The decision of whether to spend money on renting a location and hiring a professional photographer should be made through collective discussion. Since our focus is on entertainment rather than commercial activities, some people may feel that spending too much money on hobbies is not worth it so we will reach a consensus in advance. Usually, our decision-making is based on the quality of the dance. If the dance is of high quality, we will consider it worth spending more money on. Regarding the shooting location, we will choose a location suitable for the dance's style and difficulty. For example, if the dance involves a lot of ground movements, we will choose a smooth indoor surface. We enjoy the energy that dance brings us while ensuring safety. During the shooting process, it is essential to manage our expressions and try to synchronize our movements with our facial expressions to provide an excellent visual experience for the audience. </p>

		<h2>Styling</h2>
		<p>When it comes to makeup and styling, we usually choose costumes that are consistent with the dance style and colour. Sometimes, we will all shop for the original dance costumes and other times. We will also freely mix and match our existing wardrobe according to a dress code. As we primarily focus on entertainment rather than commercial activities, some people may feel that spending too much on hobbies is not worth it, so that we will reach a consensus beforehand. Generally, our decision-making is based on the quality of the dance. It is worth investing more money into the dance if we perform well. As for makeup, we usually do our own makeup to suit our individual styles. One small trick to look good on camera before shooting is to drink an iced Americano to reduce puffiness. </p>
